So i already set up the pocket base baas and i added these collections:
- Users

- This will be the default authentication table that PocketBase provides
- Fields: id, email, username, password, created, updatedm experience, dailyExperience, weeklyExperience, overallSpeed

- TypingSessions

- Purpose: Track each typing session a user completes
- Fields:
  - id (auto-generated)
  - user (relation to Users)
  - date (date)
  - duration (number) - in seconds
  - wpm (number) - words per minute
  - accuracy (number) - percentage
  - score (number) - overall score
  - keystrokes (number) - total keystrokes
  - errors (number) - total errors
  - selectedKeys (text) - which keys were practiced


- DailyGoals

- Purpose: Track user's daily practice goals and progress
- Fields:
  - id (auto-generated)
  - user (relation to Users)
  - date (date)
  - targetMinutes (number)
  - completedMinutes (number)
  - achieved (boolean)


- KeyPerformance

- Purpose: Track performance on individual keys
- Fields:
  - id (auto-generated)
  - user (relation to Users)
  - key (text) - the specific key
  - accuracy (number) - percentage
  - speed (number) - average time to press
  - lastPracticed (date)
  - errorCount (number)


- Achievements

- Purpose: Gamification elements to track user milestones
- Fields:
  - id (auto-generated)
  - user (relation to Users)
  - type (text) - e.g., "speed_milestone", "accuracy_milestone", "streak"
  - description (text)


now i want you to integrate the pocketbase database and backend in the application using this plan
Qnd btz i already installed the pocketbase sdk using npm install pocketbase

# PocketBase Integration Plan for Typing Practice App
Here's a high-level plan for integrating PocketBase into your typing practice application without the actual code implementation:

## 1. Setup and Configuration
1. Install PocketBase SDK
   
   - Add the PocketBase JavaScript SDK to your React project
2. Create PocketBase Client Configuration
   
   - Set up a central configuration file for the PocketBase client
   - Configure the connection to your PocketBase instance
## 2. Authentication System
1. Create Authentication Service
   
   - Implement registration functionality
   - Implement login/logout functionality
   - Add user session management
   - Create authentication context for React
2. Build Authentication UI
   
   - Create login form
   - Create registration form
   - Add profile page with user stats
   - Implement protected routes for authenticated users
## 3. Data Services
1. Typing Session Service
   
   - Create functions to save typing session data
   - Implement methods to retrieve user's past sessions
   - Add analytics calculations for performance trends
2. Daily Goals Service
   
   - Create functions to manage daily practice goals
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add goal completion notifications
3. Key Performance Service
   
   - Track performance metrics for individual keys
   - Calculate accuracy and speed for each key
   - Identify problem keys that need more practice
4. User Experience Service
   
   - Manage user experience points
   - Update daily and weekly experience counters
   - Track overall typing speed
   - Implement leaderboard functionality
5. Achievement Service
   
   - Create system for awarding achievements
   - Track milestone achievements (speed, accuracy, practice time)
   - Display user achievements
## 4. UI Integration
1. Modify TypingAreaComponent
   
   - Add session data saving on completion
   - Track individual keystrokes for key performance metrics
   - Update experience points after sessions
2. Create Statistics Dashboard
   
   - Display typing speed over time
   - Show accuracy trends
   - Visualize key performance data
   - Present achievement progress
3. Add Leaderboard Component
   
   - Show top users by experience
   - Allow filtering by daily/weekly/all-time
   - Display user rankings
4. Implement Goal Tracking UI
   
   - Add visual progress indicators
   - Show streak information
   - Present daily/weekly summaries
## 5. Backend Management
1. PocketBase Setup
   
   - Configure collections and fields
   - Set up proper access rules
   - Implement data validation
2. Scheduled Tasks
   
   - Create mechanism to reset daily experience at midnight
   - Implement weekly experience reset
   - Add data cleanup and maintenance tasks
## 6. Testing and Optimization
1. Test Authentication Flow
   
   - Verify registration process
   - Test login/logout functionality
   - Ensure proper session management
2. Test Data Persistence
   
   - Verify typing session data is saved correctly
   - Test retrieval and display of historical data
   - Ensure proper user data isolation
3. Optimize Performance
   
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries
   - Ensure responsive UI during data operations
## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up PocketBase
- Implement basic authentication
- Create core data services
### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement session saving
- Add basic statistics
- Create user profiles
### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Add leaderboard
- Implement achievements
- Create detailed analytics
### Phase 4: Polish
- Improve UI/UX
- Add notifications
- Implement social features
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan?
